  <p><em>Last updated: 2025-05-13</em></p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By inviting or using WelcomeGate (“the Bot”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not enable the Bot on your server.</p>

  <h2>2. Bot Functionality</h2>
  <p>WelcomeGate automates introductions, role assignments, and posts embeds based on your configured questions. You grant the Bot permission to manage channels, roles, send messages, and embed links for this purpose.</p>

  <h2>3. Data &amp; Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Bot stores only Discord IDs (guild, user, channel) and your custom intro questions/answers in a local SQLite database. No other personal data is collected.</p>

  <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>Server admins must ensure the Bot and its data are used in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service and any applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer &amp; Liability</h2>
  <p>The Bot is provided “as-is,” without warranties. The maintainer is not liable for any damages arising from its use.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use after changes implies acceptance.</p>

  <h2>Contact &amp; Support</h2>
